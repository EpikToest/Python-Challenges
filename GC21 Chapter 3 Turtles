# a. Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.
# b. Write a loop that prints each number and its square on a new line.
# c. Write a loop that adds all the numbers from the list into a variable called total. You should set the total variable to have the value 0 before you start adding them up, and print the value in total after the loop has completed.
# d. Print the product of all the numbers in the list. (product means all multiplied together)
